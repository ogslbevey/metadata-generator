        1. 'Physics' / 'Physique'
                - 'État de la mer' : Sea State is the characterization of wave and swell, typically in terms of height, wavelength, period, and directional wave energy flux. Waves generated by ocean surface stress evolve from wind waves to swell through nonlinear dynamical processes.. Wave characteristics are modified by bathymetry when the depth of the water is comparable to the wavelength, and by surface currents. Sea state is most well known for its impacts on marine safety, marine transport and damage to structures. It is also a substantial modifier of air-sea exchanges of momentum, moisture and CO2. Waves also impact beach erosion, storm-related water damage (wave set-up contributes to storm surge), surface albedo, and transport of larva and contaminants such as oil. Waves can also modify the growth or decay of sea ice. The primary aspects of sea state that are measured are the wave height (usually significant wave height (SWH), but sometimes maximum wave height), wave period and wave direction. Wavelength might be observed, but is more often inferred from period and wave phase speed. Parameters of interest that are not measured by existing systems include crest height (usually parameterized from wave spectra or SWH), wave breaking, whitecap coverage (derived from some satellite estimates, and numerical models), rogue waves, and tangentially, Stokes drift. Sea State is typically observed from moored buoys and satellite altimeters, although some wave information can be inferred from coastal radar and specialized drifting buoys, and observations are provided from some Voluntary Observing Ships and oil platforms. Most moored buoys measuring waves are located in the coastal margins of North America, Europe and Australia; other than the Australian coast, there are virtually no wave measurements in the southern hemisphere. Waves are recorded on only two of the buoys measuring eddy covariance fluxes. Current in situ reports are not standardized resulting in impaired utility. Sea State observations are so sparse compared to natural variability that wave products are derived from surface stress rather than created from wave data. The limited sea state data that are available from altimetry is sometimes assimilated. Wave products are routinely provided in weather analysis and forecast products. This lack of wave observations adversely impacts bulk estimates of surface fluxes.
                
                - 'Contraintes sur la surface océanique' : The 2-dimensional horizontal vector Ocean Surface Stress is the rate per unit area at which momentum is transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean. Ocean surface stress is therefore both the drag at the bottom of the atmosphere, and the dynamical forcing at the surface of the ocean. The magnitude of the stress influences the air-sea exchange of energy, water (evaporation), and oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases. Vector stress is needed to estimate the ageostrophic (principally Ekman) component of ocean currents, and consequently is linked to open ocean surface current convergence and divergence, coastal upwelling and down-welling and associated primary productivity. Surface stress drives coastal currents, storm surge, surface waves, and ice transport; also, ocean surface turbulence and mixed layer evolution, and is a factor in deep-water formation. Ocean surface stress is therefore critically important for determining the large scale wind- and buoyancy-driven circulation. Ocean surface stress can be measured from buoys, ships, and other ocean platforms, and from satellites, and inferred from meteorological analyses. Though surface stresses change rapidly in both time and space, satellite-based sampling density and accuracy is adequate for many applications such as estimating Ekman-current driven upwelling and driving surface wave models. After conversion to wind-like variables, incorporation of satellite data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) analyses has significantly improved NWP model skill, particularly in the tropical regions and Southern Ocean. At a limited number of locations, direct measurements of the surface wind stress are being made from buoys and ships using fast-response, 3-dimensional wind sensors. Together with observations needed to correct for platform motion caused by surface waves, these data allow direct computation of the vertical flux of momentum, and hence stress, from the covariance between vertical and horizontal wind fluctuations (so-called eddy covariance or direct flux measurements). The more common method of obtaining fluxes from observations of marine boundary layers variables (wind speed, humidity, air pressure, air temperature, sea temperature, and waves) via bulk formulae is an indirect estimate and relies on the accuracy of the bulk formula chosen and the supporting observations. Most bulk formulae are tuned against the direct eddy covariance data and perform well in typical conditions, though it is accepted that improved formulae and added tuning are needed for very low wind, very high wind, and high sea state conditions.
                
                - 'Glace de mer' : Sea ice variability is a key indicator of climate variability and change in the polar regions. The primary parameters that define the state of sea ice include: concentration, area and extent, ice type, motion, deformation, age, thickness, and volume. The presence of sea ice strongly modifies surface waves and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, moisture and gasses. Sea ice has a significant impact on the Earth’s albedo, and the properties of many water masses of the global ocean and strongly influenced determined freezing and melting processes in sea ice regions. Passive microwave satellite sensors have been providing sea ice extent, area and concentration data since 1979. Automatic sea ice classification algorithms have been taken forward by utilization of dual polarization SAR (e.g. from ENVISAT and Radarsat) and scatterometer backscatter since the beginning of the century. Sea ice freeboard measurements from satellites have been achieved using radar and laser altimetry since the 1990s. However, for both types of sensors, estimates of snow depth and snow and sea ice densities are needed to convert the freeboard height into sea ice thickness. This information, however, is not presently available from satellites. Satellite passive microwave L-band measurements used for ocean salinity measurements (e.g. SMOS) have been shown to be valuable in measuring the thickness of thin sea ice (< 0.5 m). On-ice in situ observations and subsurface observations are currently very sparse. This data are needed to provide accurate and reliable estimates of sea ice thickness and volume, and to calibrate satellite data. It is also essential to produce satellite based surface albedo for sea ice covered area. As the albedo of sea ice can't be derived only on the basis of the sea ice concentration, it is essential to produce satellite based surface albedo also for the sea ice covered area, not only land area.
                
                - 'Niveau marin' : Sea Surface Height is one of the primary indicators of global climate change. Change in the global mean sea level provides a measure of the net change in ocean mass due to melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and net change in ocean volume due to thermal expansion. The rise of sea level over the past century is known from tide gauges to be around 1.7 +/- 0.4 mm/yr. Data acquired since 1991 from satellite radar altimeters have provided an uninterrupted view of sea level on a global scale, and reveal a global average trend estimated at 3.3 +/-0.5 mm/yr. Sea level observations characterize intra-seasonal variably such as ENSO, and the correlation between sea surface height (SSH) variability and underlying subsurface temperature anomalies can be exploited to derive analyses of the upper ocean heat content and derived products such as Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential. On the regional scales, changes in sea level can be far larger than the globally averaged value and result from several factors, including changes in temperature, salinity and circulation. At ocean basin scale, land uplift associated with mass redistributions due to past and current land ice melt also cause regional variations in sea level. Estimations of changes in coastal sea level, of extreme relevance for societal impacts, are under-sampled by the current altimeter. Coastal products are therefore usually improved with additional knowledge of winds and tides. In situ Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) water level gauges provide calibration and validation data to complement satellite observations, whilst GLOSS data themselves monitor multi-decadal trends in sea level rise and help reconcile the sea level signal associated with crustal displacements. Satellite gravity measurements assist the separation of sea level into changes of the ocean mass and thermal expansion. They are also required to obtain the oceanic geoid, which is a gravitational equipotential surface that represents the shape the ocean surface would take if it were at rest and at a standard uniform density. The difference between the geoid and the altimetric measurements represent the ocean circulation and changes thereof. Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) water level gauges measure sea level at coastlines relative to local fixed datum or, if they are equipped with GNSS/GPS positioning, relative to a global geodetic coordinate system. In situ GLOSS data complement satellite calibration and validation efforts. GLOSS data also monitor multi-decadal trends in local relative sea level rise, and help reconcile the sea level signal associated with crustal displacements.
                
                - 'Température de surface' : Sea-surface temperature (SST) is a vital component of the climate system as it exerts a major influence on the exchanges of energy, momentum and gases between the ocean and atmosphere. SST largely controls the atmospheric response to the ocean at both weather and climate time scales. Daily variations in SST can exceed 3°C and could alter the surface energy budget by more than 10 Wm-2 over the tropics and subtropics. Therefore, the SST and horizontal gradients in SST are also important for coupling with the atmosphere for accurate numerical weather predictions (NWP) and sub-seasonal to seasonal prediction timescales. The spatial patterns of SST reveal the structure of the underlying ocean dynamics, such as, ocean fronts, eddies, coastal upwelling and exchanges between the coastal shelf and open ocean. In situ measurements comprise a database that currently extends back to the late 18th century, with the prospect of additional recovered and digitized historical measurements being added. Over this time period, the types of available measurements and their areal coverage have significantly changed. In the past 30 years, near-global sampling of SST has become available on daily to weekly basis due to the advent of infrared and microwave radiometers on polar-orbiting satellites and infrared radiometers on geosynchronous satellites. In situ SST observations are taken from a variety of platforms, including, ships, buoys, drifters and floats. In situ observations are essential for calibration and validation of satellite data. Therefore, planning, development and prioritization of both satellite and in situ components need to be considered in concert. Satellite Sea Surface Temperature applies to the skin temperature down to a few mm, and is sometime adjusted down to the foundation depth (the depth at which diurnal heating is not important), but largely focuses on the upper few millimetres. The skin temperature (the temperature within a few micrometers of the surface) plays an important role in air-sea exchange of energy, moisture, and carbon. This temperature can be used to describe the long wave radiation emitted from the ocean surface. Surface temperature observations are an important input to data assimilation ocean models that are being used to provide gridded global estimates of ocean circulation at varying spatial and temporal scales. Surface temperature observations are required to further our understanding of the ocean’s role in the global energy budget, and to further quantify ocean changes in response to ongoing climate variability and change.
                
                - 'Température sous la surface' : Subsurface temperature measurements monitor climate variability and change, and are important to detecting and inferring the relative contribution of ocean heat content to changes to sea level. The uptake of heat by the global ocean, estimated at more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system in the past few decades, helps to mitigate surface warming but in turn increases the global ocean volume through thermal expansion. Subsurface ocean temperature is a fundamental observation for many ocean phenomena that influence climate including ocean stratification, circulation, mixed layer, water mass properties, and coastal shelf-open ocean exchange. Many profiling subsurface temperature observation systems also contribute to the network of in-situ validation for satellite observations of surface temperature. Major observed changes in the marine environment are a response to changes in ocean physics. Changes in subsurface temperature are one of the most significant physical changes observed and which (in)directly affects the wealth of a variety of ocean services of societal and environmental benefit, over a broad range of temporal (from short to long term) and spatial scales (from global to local). Changes in ocean temperature, for example, can influence the growth rate of farmed fish as well as the distribution and abundance of wild fish stocks and other marine species of significant economic and social value. Subsurface temperature observing systems acquire data over a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Moorings offer very high temporal resolution at specific locations, but with spatial resolution limited by density of the array. Gliders and other autonomous platforms achieve much higher spatial resolution depending on endurance and other instrument characteristics. Expendable probes dropped from a network of volunteer commercial vessels along major shipping routes observe temperature to several hundred meters depth on a roughly seasonal repeat schedule. The global network of profiling floats (Argo) delivers temperature profiles (nominally 0-2000 m) from which monthly to annual scale global maps of temperature distribution are derived. Cable-based observations are now being used at select sites. Ship-based Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) observations provide full depth temperature observations from boundary current scale to basin scale depending on horizontal resolutions and tracks of research voyages. Ocean temperature observations are an important input for data assimilation ocean models that provide gridded global estimates of ocean circulation at varying spatial and temporal scales. On-going temperature observations are required to further our understanding of the ocean’s role in the global energy budget, and to further quantify ocean changes in response to climate variability and change.
                
                - 'Courants de surface' : The surface ocean general circulation is responsible for significant surface transport of heat, salt, passive tracers and ocean pollutants. On basin scales, surface currents and their variations are a major player in climate to weather fluctuations. Parameterized wind stress and heat flux depend upon the speed of the near-surface wind relative to the moving ocean surface, which can be significantly affected at large scales by surface currents such as the western boundary currents and Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and at smaller scales by mesoscale variability. Convergences/divergences, spiralling eddies, and filaments all contribute to vertical motions and mass exchange. Surface currents impact the steepness of surface waves, and are thus important for generating accurate marine sea state forecasts. Because of their significance in advecting passive particles, knowledge of surface currents is also important for applications such as oil spill and marine debris response, search and rescue operations, and ship routing. Currents, particularly tidal currents, can also modify storm surge impacts and sea level changes. The existing surface current observing system captures much of this range. Moorings and land-based HF-radars are local, frequent, but limited in coverage. Lagrangian drifting buoys and satellite altimeter derived surface geostrophic currents are global. Drifters give fast timescales (hourly observations) but with irregular coverage at approximately one point within a 5 degree box at any time. Recently satellite based SAR interferometry and range Doppler shift have demonstrated the capability to detect the surface current. The Stokes drift inverted from the surface wave spectrum is also emerging as a new method. Surface current products from drifters and moorings as well as HF-radar systems are predominantly used for improved understanding of surface currents, eddies and air-sea fluxes, and exchange between the coastal and open ocean. They are also heavily used as a validation of modelled surface current. Altimeter based sea level anomaly (relates to surface geostrophic current) and HF-radar surface current are assimilated into operational ocean model systems.
                
                - 'Courants sous la surface' : Observations of subsurface ocean velocity contribute to estimates of ocean transports of mass, heat, freshwater, and other properties on local, to regional and basin to global scales. Subsurface ocean velocity provides the necessary data to resolve complex velocity structure in the major boundary currents and at the ocean sea floor, and near the equator. Velocity profile information can be used to estimate the order of ocean mixing using fine-scale parameterizations of turbulent dissipation by internal wave breaking. This is able to provide global and regional maps of mixing variability (turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate). Subsurface velocity observations are obtained via direct measurements of the ocean velocity or indirectly from observations of temperature, salinity and pressure using the geostrophic approximation. Subsurface boundary currents, equatorial currents, and other constrained intense currents are observed directly using moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) at hourly time resolutions. Gliders, using similar techniques, are beginning to be used to monitor boundary currents and ocean eddies. Shipboard ADCP and Lowered ADCP provide surface and subsurface current data from boundary current scale to basin scale depending on horizontal resolutions and tracks of research voyages. While the vertical shear of the component of horizontal velocity perpendicular to each station pair of a hydrographic section is straightforward to calculate from geostrophy, determining the absolute velocity field to sufficient accuracy for transport estimates is more problematic. In this respect, an important contribution to subsurface velocity observing is Lagrangian subsurface current measurements derived from the drift at 1000 dbar of Argo profiling floats. These data can be combined with other ocean current observation to obtain gridded basin-scale full depth geostrophic velocity estimates. Velocity estimates can be combined in data assimilation models to provide gridded global estimates of ocean circulation at varying temporal and spatial scales. Gridded time varying ocean velocity observations provide the estimates of local and global mean and eddy kinetic energy. These products are used to assess and improve the reliability of numerical ocean models.
                
                - 'Salinité de surface': Sea Surface salinity observations contribute to monitoring the global water cycle (evaporation, precipitation and glacier and river runoff). On large scales, surface salinity can be used to infer long-term changes of the global hydrological cycle. Surface salinity, together with surface temperature, is indicative of the surface expression of ocean frontal features and eddies. Sea Surface Salinity is observed principally in situ from flow-through water intake systems on research and commercial ships, or conductivity sensors deployed on autonomous floats, drifters, and unmanned surface vehicles. More recently, the advent of satellite sea surface salinity sensors has provided less precise but global coverage including marginal seas and better spatiotemporal sampling than the in situ observation network. In situ surface observations will remain an important validation and calibration complement to satellite observing.Ocean surface salinity observations provide an important input for data assimilation ocean models that are being used to provide gridded global estimates of ocean circulation at varying spatial and temporal scales. The complementarity of satellite and in-situ SSS observations is needed to resolve sea surface salinity features important to ocean circulation and marine biogeochemistry, and linkages with weather forecasts, and seasonal to multi-decadal variability and predictability of the global water cycle.
                
                - 'Salinité sous la surface' : The global sub-surface salinity observing system is vital for closure of the global hydrological cycle, estimates of oceanic evaporation and precipitation, and halosteric component of sea level change. Sub-surface salinity, along with coincident subsurface temperature and velocity observations, are required to calculate in-situ density and ocean mass and freshwater transports. Salinity observations are an important in-situ validation for satellite observations of sea surface salinity (SSS). In addition, subsurface salinity, together with temperature and pressure and satellite surface observations of SST, SSS and SSH are used to derive large-scale gridded climate products including ocean velocity, mixed-layer depth, density stratification, sea level and indirect interior ocean mixing used in many weather and climate applications.Subsurface salinity observing systems acquire data over a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Moorings offer very high temporal resolution at specific locations, but with spatial resolution limited by density of the array. Gliders and other autonomous platforms achieve much higher spatial resolution depending on endurance and other instrument characteristics. The global network of profiling floats (Argo) delivers salinity profiles (nominally 0-2000 m) from which monthly to annual scale global maps of temperature distribution are derived. Cable-based observations are now being used at select sites. Ship-based Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) observations provide full depth salinity observations from boundary current scale to basin scale depending on horizontal resolutions and tracks of research voyages. Ocean salinity observations are an important input for data assimilation ocean models that are being used to provide gridded global and regional estimates of ocean circulation at varying spatial and temporal scales. On-going salinity observations are required to further our understanding of the ocean’s role in the global water cycle, and to further quantify ocean changes in response to climate change.
                
                - 'Flux de chaleur océanique de surface' : Surface heat flux is the rate of exchange of heat, per unit area, crossing the sea surface from ocean to atmosphere. The net heat flux is the sum of turbulent (latent and sensible) fluxes and the radiative (short wave and long wave) components. Oceanographic convention is that a positive flux implies heating of the ocean. Latent heat flux is associated with the phase change of water during evaporation or condensation and proportional to evaporation. Sensible heat flux is the rate at which heat is transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere by conduction and convection. In the tropics, latent heat flux is typically an order of magnitude greater than sensible heat flux, but in polar regions they are similar in magnitude. Downward shortwave at the surface is predominantly visible light. Upward shortwave flux is reflected sunlight, often determined by parameterization of surface albedo. While sensible, latent, and longwave heat fluxes occur at the sea surface, the shortwave radiation penetrates seawater and is absorbed with depth. These fluxes are major contributors to energy and moisture budgets, and are largely responsible for thermodynamic coupling of the ocean and atmosphere on all scales. Variability of these fluxes is in part related to largescale variability in weather (climate) patterns. For most regions, the two major components are the net shortwave gain by the ocean and the latent heat flux loss by the ocean. Sensible and latent heat fluxes have traditionally been estimated through bulk formulae with the aid of the observations of SST, near surface air temperature and humidity, surface winds, waves, and surface air pressure. These estimate have regional and seasonal biases because of assumptions and missing wave data. We now measure or infer the above bulk variables from satellite observations, therefore it is clear that these fluxes can be globally estimated from satellite; however, this is currently hampered by limited ground truth. At a very limited number of locations, direct measurements of the sensible and latent heat flux are being made on buoys and ships using fast-response, three-dimensional wind sensors together with fast-response air temperature and humidity sensors. These sensors, together with the observations needed to correct for platform motion, allow direct computation sensible and latent heat flux through covariance flux methods. There have been efforts to estimate radiative fluxes from visual cloud estimates, but even monthly averages are very noisy. Radiative fluxes can be measured directly from buoys, ships, and other ocean platforms using sensors to measure downward shortwave and longwave. Buoys that measure surface meteorology as well as downward shortwave and longwave can thus approximate all four components of ocean surface heat flux. Air-sea exchanges (fluxes) are sensitive indicators of changes in the climate system, with links to floods and droughts1, and East Coast storm intensity and storm tracks2 and tropical storm intensity. On longer temporal scales, several well-known climate variations (e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation; North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) are associated with variability in these fluxes and hypothetically impact of changes of these fluxes on regional economies, populations and infrastructure. For example, the contribution to the water cycle alone is often extremely important. Improved predictions of ENSO phase and associated impact on regional weather patterns could be extremely useful to the agricultural community. These fluxes also contribution to cool wakes behind tropical cyclones, which influence the intensity of tropical cyclones later (up to a month) in the season. These fluxes will be critical for successful coupling of ocean and atmospheric models (as well as ice models) for the purpose of climate forecasts.
                
                - 'Pression au fond de l'océan' : Ocean bottom pressure (OBP) is the total pressure resulting from the weight or mass of the column of seawater and the overlaying atmosphere. Indeed, both fluctuations in the atmospheric sea level pressure, in the dynamic topography, and fluctuations in the mass of the fluid column between the unperturbed surface and bottom contribute to the observed OBP variability. Therefore, the OBP variability is tightly connected with sea surface height variability, which is also directly affected by atmospheric loading and the hydrological cycle. OBP serves as a proxy of ocean mass variability - a key parameter needed in many geophysical applications such as large-scale ocean circulation or variability in the Earth’s gravity field. Overall, observations of OBP significantly contribute to understanding the characteristics, dynamics, and temporal variability of many important oceanographic and geophysical phenomena. While OBP is highly valuable as a stand-alone parameter, synergisms abound when OBP observations are combined with measurements of other variables. Despite the importance of OBP, it is severely under-sampled globally and regionally because it cannot be directly measured remotely. Presently, OBP can only be inferred from GRACE data. Sensors on the seafloor are required to remain in place for years to measure the scales required for most applications. In combination with relative or absolute sea-level (SL) observations, such as from satellite altimetry, OBP observations reveal the key mass component of long-time-scale SL changes. That is, thermal expansion, deducible from changes in water temperatures, does not change the mass of the water column, and so is not observed in OBP. However, glacier and ice cap melting does increase the mass of the oceans, in a complex pattern across the globe, and so is observed in OBP. Distributed OBP observations, with proper consideration of sensor drift as well as vertical land movement like all relative SL observations, will enable the definition of how water column mass varies geographically, helping test climate change model predictions. OBP observations are becoming more valuable now as opposed to 10 years ago because methods are being tested to self-calibrate OBP sensors, which promises to eliminate the problem of long-term drift that has hampered their use for studying interannual and longer time scale variability. Defining the geographical structure of mass changes in the oceans is also an objective of the GRACE satellite mission (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). However, GRACE provides only a coarse horizontal resolution of bottom pressure and is only valid far from continental boundaries. GRACE is sensitive to scales of variability longer than at least a few hundred kilometers. Its orbit leads to time-space scale aliasing issues and trade-offs between temporal and spatial resolution. Distributed OBP sensors will provide observations with high resolution in time, unlike GRACE, and can provide better horizontal resolution where desired, such as under the strongest elements of the ocean circulation system (e.g. DONET array). In fact, due to the dominant balance of forces between the horizontal gradients of pressure and the velocity structure of currents at periods longer than a day, accurate OBP observations can provide estimates of both basin-wide modes of transport between OBP sensors located on opposing continental slopes and local bottom current amplitudes related to local energetic circulation features when deployed in proximity. All of these observations are needed to improve the accuracy of numerical models of global ocean circulation. Deriving transports from pressure gradients is such a fundamentally important issue that it was one of the principal arguments for the construction and launch of GRACE. The value of distributed OBP observations is very similar toand greatly complements, the value of the GRACE missions. OBP improves the calibration and validation of the GRACE Follow-On and subsequent remote sensing missions. A distinct advantage of OBP sensors will be their ability to resolve well in time and in space, through regional arrays, the variability of large-scale circulation on time scales of days, weeks, and months, especially at latitudes poleward of ~40o where surface and deep flows are most tightly linked. At periods less than a day, OBP is sensitive to even the weakest gravitational tides, internal tides and other internal waves, tsunamis and other infragravity waves, and storm surges. Observing tsunamis is a critical task for GOOS. The determination of very accurate tidal constants, including secular changes, is possible due to low geophysical “noise” at the seafloor, and is essential to de-aliasing and correcting other measurements, especially those from satellites or SL sensors, and provides essential context for studies of the structure of Earth’s crust. Using OBP observations to study oceanic phenomena goes hand in hand with studying the vertical deformation of the seafloor. Rates of uplift of subsea volcanos can be many tens of cm per year; coseismic tectonic deformation at subduction zones can lead to sudden vertical seafloor movements up to meters, and interseismic rebound can account for vertical movements at rates of several cm/yr for years after the seismic event. Resolving OBP with corrections for the oceanographic effects and sea level change can provide important information on the changing shape of the seafloor and tectonic processes associated with great megathrust earthquakes that cause large tsunamis and significant hazards. At the same time, any interpretation of OBP data as evidence for sea level change must include knowledge of the tectonic activity at the site of the pressure observation (or vice-versa) as the tectonic uplift and subsidence rates can be similar to the rate of sea level change.
        
        2. 'Biochemistry' / 'Biogéochimie'
                - 'Oxygène' : Oceanic measurements of dissolved oxygen have a long history, and oxygen (O2) is the third-most oft-measured water quantity after temperature and salinity. Because of technological advances in the last decade oxygen observations are poised to make the same breakthrough regarding frequency and depth of measurements that temperature and salinity observations made in this decade by utilizing profiling floats and other autonomous platforms. The implementation of a full-fledged observatory of oxygen in the ocean is critical to measure and understand the large (mostly) decreasing trends in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the ocean over the last few decades. These trends have important implications for our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Sub-surface oxygen concentrations in the ocean everywhere reflect a balance between supply through circulation and ventilation and consumption by respiratory processes, the absolute amount of oxygen in a given location is therefore very sensitive to changes in either process. Oceanic oxygen has therefore been proposed as a bellwether indicator of climate change. Moreover, a global ocean O2 observing network can improve the atmospheric oxygen to nitrogen ratio (O2/N2) constraint on the ocean-land-partitioning of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2). Annual cycles in oxygen concentration that are observed below the euphotic zone will also allow determination of the seasonal to interannual net remineralization rates as a proxy for export production. It will help interpretation of variations in water mass ventilation rates and will provide crucial data (initial conditions, evaluation) for ocean biogeochemistry models. It will aid interpretation of sparse data from repeat hydrographic surveys that are needed, for example, to constrain the oceanic inventory of anthropogenic CO2.
                
                - 'Nutriments' : The availability of inorganic macronutrients (nitrate (NO3), phosphate (PO4), silicic acid (Si(OH)4), ammonium (NH4), nitrite (NO2)) in the upper ocean frequently limits and regulates the amount of organic carbon fixed by phytoplankton, thereby constituting a key control mechanism of carbon and biogeochemical cycling. There is a number of biogeographic regions in the open ocean characterized by different macronutrient regimes, either permanently or seasonally limiting the growth of phytoplankton. Measuring changes in macronutrient concentrations is essential to constraining net biological production and export fluxes, detecting shifts in biogeographic regimes, but also monitoring eutrophication phenomena.
                
                - 'Carbone inorganique' : The ocean is a major component of the global carbon cycle, exchanging massive quantities of carbon in natural cycles driven by the ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. Since seawater has a high capacity for absorbing carbon, the ocean also is a significant modulator of the rate of accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus slows the rate of global warming. The net carbon uptake of the ocean is approximately 25% of each year’s anthropogenic emissions. Due to the chemistry of carbon in water, this uptake is causing a decline in ocean pH, also known as ocean acidification. The ecological consequences of ocean acidification are a focus for much of the present research. Understanding current carbon uptake by the ocean is critical for understanding how the carbon cycle and climate are evolving under the impact of human activities, and the mechanistic understanding developed is needed in the interest of improved prediction of the state of the climate system. Understanding and predicting rates of ocean acidification are also fundamental to understanding the ocean’s biogeochemical evolution. The observations required to constrain the carbon system at a point in space and time are any two of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Total Alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and pH, and associated physical variables (temperature and salinity). The carbon system is in a delicate balance such that high quality observations will continue to be required.
                
                - 'Traceurs transitoires' : Transient tracers are a group of (chemical) compounds that can be used in the ocean to quantify ventilation, transit time distribution and transport time-scales. These compounds are all conservative in seawater, or have well-defined decay functions, and a well-established source function over time at the ocean surface. Measurement of transient tracers in the interior ocean thus provides information on the time-scales since the ocean was ventilated, i.e. in contact with the atmosphere. Knowledge of the transit time distribution (TTD) of a water-mass allows for inference of the concentrations or fates of other transient compounds, such as anthropogenic carbon or nitrous oxide. Commonly measured transient tracers are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 11 and 12, although in the past also CFC-113 and CCl4 have been measured. More recently also the related compound sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is regularly measured since it provides information on ventilation of the fast ventilated parts of the ocean. The radioactive isotopes 14C and tritium (that decays to the stable 3He) are commonly used, and have a natural decay time in addition to anthropogenic input during the 1950s. The tritium-3He couple adds unique, additional information in that whereas the other transient tracers trace pathways into the ocean from the surface, tritiugenic-3He traces the reverse pathway back out. That is, it is a nutrient-like tracer, being generated at a known rate by tritium decay and escaping to the surface ocean where it is “zeroed out” by gas exchange with the atmosphere. Although strictly not a transient tracer, since it is produced naturally by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, the argon isotope 39Ar has a half-life in the right order of magnitude to characterize global ocean ventilation and have an impeccable inertness. Difficult measurement techniques have hampered its use, but recently new technologies are emerging that might allow for a global survey of 39Ar in the near future.
                
                - 'Matière particulaire' : Particulate matter includes a number of variables that describe the suspended particulates (total suspended matter; TSM) and particulate matter transport in the ocean, both organic and inorganic fractions. Particulate Organic Matter (POM) includes Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON). Although it represents a combined measurement of living cells and detrital matter, POM concentration in the surface ocean co-varies with living biomass and thus provides quantitative information on spatial gradients and temporal variations in biomass. Below the euphotic zone, measurement of POM can provide information on organic matter export fluxes and rates of microbial respiration. Observation of POM within a global observing system would directly address the question of whether the ocean’s biomass and productivity are changing. Changes in POM could be important indicators of deteriorating water quality due to eutrophication in coastal regions, and of declines in primary production that could potentially translate up the food chain negatively impacting fisheries. Measurements of the inorganic fraction include Particulate Inorganic Carbon (PIC), which primarily represents calcareous shells of calcifying organisms, as well as biogenic silica (BSi). Observation of PIC would directly address the question of what impacts ocean acidification has on calcareous organisms and thus community structure. When combined with traditional ship-based measurements for calibration and validation POC, PON and PIC can be measured autonomously using bio-optical sensors and from space. Apart from aeolian deposition, particulate matter transport originates from biological processes, such as primary production, calcite (or aragonite) production, and particle sinking, the latter including all processes that may change the particles' sinking speed (e.g., grazing by zooplankton, or aggregation). Thus, they strongly depend of the state of the biological system at the surface, as determined by season, biogeography, etc. The potentially large variation in time and space, together with methodological complications for a long time has complicated the direct observation (via shallow sediment traps) of particulate matter export on global scale. Derived estimates of export, such as calculated from remote sensing, include assumptions about biogeochemical interactions, that, when used for model evaluation, may not coincide with model prerequisites. Recent approaches to assess particulate matter export from optical methods might allow for more direct, but quasi-synoptic data sets, particularly when mounted on autonomous platforms. These methods are still under development. In conjunction with particulate matter export, it would also be desirable to quantify the transport of dissolved organic matter out of and into the ocean surface layer. However, it is difficult to observe these fluxes directly, and it may be an option to determine those from a combination of particle flux measurements and observations of dissolved matter concentrations. The overall readiness for routinely measuring particulate matter export is unfortunately still poor. The potentially most straightforward way would be to start with available remotely sensed ocean colour, to derive gross primary production from these fields, and to use calibrated transfer functions for particle export as based on in-situ measurements (sediment trap data, measurements of dissolved concentrations). This methodology still has big problems, especially for deriving fluxes of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and biogenic silica (BSi). For inert clay material fluxes the method would not work at all and one would have to rely on in situ measurements. In any case, remotely sensed data can help to identify spatial patterns of biogenic export production. A step change in in situ observations using direct methods including bio-optical technology is needed. Pilot projects should start soon in order to find best practicable solutions.
                
                - 'Protoxyde d'azote' : Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important climate-relevant trace gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. In the troposphere it acts as a strong greenhouse gas and in the stratosphere it acts as an ozone depleting substance because it is the precursor of ozone depleting nitric oxide radicals. Because of the on-going decline of chlorofluorocarbons and the continuous increase of N2O in the atmosphere, the contributions of N2O to both the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion will be even more pronounced in the 21st century. The ocean - including its coastal areas such as continental shelves, estuaries and upwelling areas - is a major source of N2O and contributes about 30% to the atmospheric N2O budget. Oceanic N2O is mainly produced as a by-product during archaeal nitrification (i.e. ammonium oxidation to nitrate) whereas bacterial nitrification seems to be of minor importance as source of oceanic N2O. N2O occurs also as an intermediate during microbial denitrification (nitrate reduction via N2O to dinitrogen, N2). Nitrification is the dominating N2O production process, whereas denitrification contributes only 7-35% to the overall N2O water column budget in the ocean. The amount of N2O produced during both nitrification and denitrification strongly depends on the prevailing dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations and is significantly enhanced under low (i.e. suboxic) O2 conditions. N2O is usually not detectable in anoxic waters because of its reduction to N2 during denitrification. Thus, significantly enhanced N2O concentrations are generally found at oxic/suboxic or oxic/anoxic boundaries. The strong O2 sensitivity of N2O production is also observed in coastal characterised by seasonal shifts in the O2 regime. A biological source of N2O in the well-oxygenated mixed layer/euphotic zone seems to be unlikely. Global maps of N2O in the surface ocean show enhanced N2O anomalies (i.e. supersaturation of N2O) in equatorial upwelling regions as well as N2O anomalies close to zero (i.e. near equilibrium) in large parts of the open ocean. The MEMENTO (The MarinE MethanE and NiTrous Oxide database: https://memento.geomar.de) project has been launched with the aim to collect and archive N2O data sets and to provide actual fields of surface N2O for emission estimates.
                
                - 'Isotopes stables du carbone' : The utility of carbon-13 isotope (δ13C, the carbon-13 to carbon-12 isotope ratio 13C/12C) as a tracer of the ocean’s carbon cycle is observation limited. By observing the temporal development of the lightening of the oceanic inorganic carbon pool due to the uptake of CO2 originating from the burning of 13C-depleted fossil fuel carbon, a phenomenon also known as oceanic 13C Suess effect, an estimation of the anthropogenic carbon fraction of DIC is possible. Recent improvements in measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas dissolved in seawater using field portable spectrometers open up the possibility of underway 13C/12C observations across large portions of the surface ocean. Such data sets would substantially improve δ13C-based estimates of organic matter (OM) export rate and of the air-sea 13CO2 flux. The latter term can be compared to depth-integrated 13CO2 inventory changes in the water column to provide a separation of anthropogenic CO2 change due to air-sea CO2 flux versus change due physical transport by ocean circulation. Recent application of this approach in the North Atlantic indicates that 50% of the anthropogenic CO2 increase in this ocean basin is a result of transport from the South Atlantic as part of the meridional overturning circulation.
                
                - 'Carbone organique dissous' : Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents one of the largest exchangeable reservoirs of organic material on Earth. At 662 ±32 Pg (1015 g) of carbon (C), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exceeds the inventory of organic particles in the oceans by 200 fold, making it one of the largest of the bioreactive pools of carbon in the ocean, second only to dissolved inorganic carbon (38,100 Pg C). The size of the reservoir (comparable to that of atmospheric carbon dioxide), as well as its role as a sink for autotrophically fixed carbon, as a substrate to heterotrophic microbes, and as a sink/source of carbon involved in climate variations over long time scales, highlights its importance in the ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles. DOC is exported from the epipelagic zone at 1.9 Pg C yr-1, contributing 20% to the biological pump via meridional overturning circulation.

        3. 'Biology and Ecosystems' / 'Biologie et écosystèmes'
                - 'Biomasse et diversité phytoplanctonique' : Many of the ecosystem services supporting human activities in coastal and ocean waters depend on photosynthetic microorganisms representing the lowest trophic levels in the ocean, fixing carbon and producing oxygen. During our lifetimes, indirect and direct human pressures and changes occurring in the natural environment are having significant impacts on these microbial assemblages. Over billions of years these organisms have changed the planet by fixing carbon and producing oxygen, resulting in an environment that sustains human life. These changes can affect fishery catch potential, patterns of harmful algal bloom occurrence, the dispersal of invasive or introduced species, and cause other shifts in marine habitats of the coastal zone, the continental shelf, or the open ocean; many that we have yet to recognize. They affect the jobs, the economy, and the well-being of coastal communities. These services are the foundation for resilient coastal communities and for what is conceived as the ‘blue economy’ (Briscoe et al., 2016; Spinrad, 2014). Sustaining such valuable ecosystem services is at the core of food and health security of every coastal nation (Golden et al., 2017). High-biomass and/or toxic proliferations of some specific cells (or “Harmful Algal Blooms” or HABs), are known to cause harm to aquatic ecosystems, including plants and animals, and to humans via direct exposure to water-borne toxins or by toxic seafood consumption. Ecosystem damage by high-biomass blooms may include, for instance, disruption of food webs, fish-killing by gill damage, or contribution to low oxygen “dead-zones” after bloom degradation. Some species also produce potent natural chemicals (toxins) that can persist in the water or enter the food web, leading to illness or death of aquatic animals and/or human seafood consumers. Many HABs are increasing in severity and frequency, and biogeographical range.
                Causes are complex, but in some cases can be attributed to climate change and human impacts, including eutrophication, habitat modification, and human-mediated introduction of exogenous species. Monitoring lower trophic levels is relevant since these organisms form the base of the marine food web, play critical roles in global biogeochemistry, and are highly sensitive to ecosystem perturbations both at the bottom and top of the trophic structure. The abundance of many fish species, sea birds, and marine mammals on continental shelves is critically tied to fluctuations in the abundance of smaller planktonic organisms driven by climate-scale changes (Ryther, 1969). On the other hand, changes in the grazing pressure by fish and zooplankton also have a marked influence on the diversity, abundance, and productivity of these microorganisms. Today, there are efforts underway to develop a Marine Biodiversity Observation System (MBON) to help provide guidance to monitor the number and diversity of organisms from low- to upper trophic levels of the food web. The development of a community of practices that follows a standardized approach to observations is critical to integrate observations about life into the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and to ensure access to observations by users, and conduct analyses such as those enabled by the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). Proactive efforts to inform mitigation and adaptation policies have to be based on observations, scientific insight and technological inventiveness, so that nations around the globe can more effectively monitor their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Such efforts are also important to understand changes in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), and in the high seas in general. The approach to measure and monitor phytoplankton and HAB EOV should include multiple observing tools in order to characterize the biological diversity of these organisms, their phenology, vertical distribution, and community composition, and their role in ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem services. The type of basic information required about these organisms, and recommendations for methods and best practices for data archive, is being documented by an operational Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON; Biodiversity Ad Hoc Group, 2010; Duffy et al., 2013; Muller-Karger et al., 2014). The measurements should collected routinely by operational and research programs such as by elements of the GOOS. These observations, including relevant environmental data, should be archived using guidelines established by OBIS for eventual facilitation of regional to global assessments. It is recognized that existing phytoplankton monitoring includes bulk measurements (e.g. pigments, size-based functional groups), target species (e.g. HABs), phytoplankton functional types, and full biodiversity measurements (species, genomics). Development of a standardized international effort that targets biological diversity should be the goal, with the understanding that characterization of phytoplankton at lower spatial and temporal resolution may be an operational necessity and remains valuable.
                
                - 'Biomasse et diversité zooplanctonique' : Zooplankton is a broad category of the plankton that includes all animal or animal-like organisms whose dispersal in the ocean is dominated by physical processes such as ocean currents. The zooplankton includes protozoans and metazoans. Zooplankton are the food for many mammals, birds, fish, corals and other invertebrates including zooplankton. They are consumers of the phytoplankton and can also be carnivorous. They are an intermediary between primary productivity and higher trophic levels. They also play a key role in defining the chemistry of the ocean by recycling nutrients and carbon in near-surface waters of the ocean and by delivering these materials to deeper ocean waters through defecation and through daily and ontogenetic migration. Zooplankton biomass is an important and commonly used variable to evaluate fisheries potential and ecosystem health. The zooplankton can be extremely diverse. Zooplankton diversity refers to the number of zooplankton species, taxonomic composition, or community structure within a region. Zooplankton diversity influences ecosystem health and productivity through trophic links. In turn, zooplankton diversity is sensitive to environmental pressures such as climate change, including ocean acidification, warming and deoxygenation. The abundance and functional types of zooplankton, even their presence or absence, are accepted indicators of marine ecosystem responses to climate change. Ichthyoplankton surveys, focussing on larval fish species, can also be informative for zooplankton diversity. Zooplankton biomass is most commonly measured as wet weight, dry weight, and also as carbon content, nitrogen content, protein and lipid content. Recent approaches also include acoustic and optical detection of zooplankton biomass. Observation and measurement of zooplankton abundance and diversity are obtained through various methods, which traditionally have involved the use of vertically or horizontally towed nets (with mesh sizes ranging from less than 100 μm up to 500 μm) but more recently include instruments such as video plankton recorders which collect an image of the organisms in situ. In terms of consistent and most extensive sampling effort, the best example to date is that of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) which collects observations along the track of ships of opportunity in some areas of the world. CPR surveys are brought together through the Global Alliance of CPR Survey (GACS). Net tow sampling is conducted in extensive and long-standing projects by various regional fisheries and oceanography surveys (e.g., the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, CalCOFI). Some collections are conducted as part of research and fisheries programs, some of which are part of regional Ocean Observing Systems (OOS). With respect to specific methods/tools, there is a need for coordination and standardization of data for global comparisons. Techniques may be developed that can bring together the different approaches and methodologies and may yield useful metrics despite challenges in merging differently acquired data. A challenge for this EOV to become fully mature is to secure funding to fill the geographical observation gaps and support capacity building for sample processing, since taxonomic skills are necessary to generate diversity measurements.
                
                - 'Abondance et diversité de poissons': Fish and fisheries are key parts of ecosystems, economies and societies. Fish consume lower trophic level organisms, including plankton and other fish, and are consumed by marine mammals, seabirds, fish, invertebrates, and microorganisms. Many fish serve as grazers in different ecosystems (coral reefs, rocky bottoms), ensuring their ecological balance. Fisheries provide food for a large fraction of the world’s population, meal and oil for aquaculture, and livelihoods for fishers. Fish and fisheries occupy important roles in societies, including traditional cultures. Fish and fisheries are affected by climate variability and are vulnerable to climate change. Food security affects fisheries and, in turn, both are affected by human population growth and climate. For these and other reasons, the abundance and spatial distribution of fish of different species need to be measured routinely, widely and in a standardized manner. Such information is useful to inform a variety of types of decisions, including those that involve fisheries management, conservation and sustainable use policies, and that affect economic investment and societal resilience in the face of climate change. Fish abundance describes the biomass or numbers of fish in the ocean. It can be reported in terms of species or taxonomic or functional groups (e.g., small pelagic fish, mesopelagic fish, and tunalike species) in an assemblage, population, stock or area, or globally. Fish spatial distribution describes the presence-absence of fish in the ocean or the spatial distribution of fish abundance. Both fish abundance and distribution can be reported at local, national, regional or global scales. There are two main sources of information on fish: fisheries data and scientific monitoring (fisheries-independent) data. Time series of fisheries data are more accessible and have broader geographic coverage when reported. Yet they only concern target species and stages of larger fisheries. However they may also include bycatch species collected through observer programs. Overall fisheries data can be biased as they highly depend on fishing effort and strategy. Many nations conduct stock assessments for valuable species within their EEZs; while intergovernmental organizations conduction stock assessments for transboundary species. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations routinely receives fisheries data and stock information from most nations, although these are generally restricted to fish catch and not abundance. The Sea Around Us Project (SAUP) compiles data from a large variety of sources to estimate fishery statistics for stocks and regions globally, and attempts to correct it with some bycatch estimates and other data. Other sources include many national, multinational and regional fishery management organizations (RFMOs). Small-scale, artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries are less well documented. Access to fisheries-independent data is more complicated. Such data are often the property of non-governmental or government institutions. Fisheries independent data are costly to acquire, and thus time series do not exist for many areas, especially in developing countries. Fisheries independent data are however essential to monitor and evaluate the status of fish species and marine ecosystems more accurately than using only fisheries-dependent catch estimates. Because most fisheries-independent surveys target exploited species and their ecosystems, observations of unexploited species are often also lacking. Fish are observed in a variety of ways. Basic reporting of presence or absence or species richness of fish can be derived from diverse observational programs and are compiled in global databases, such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). Collections from museums can also be used for some assessments. Time series of the catch of many fish are publically available from the FAO. Complex issues of data collection, standardization and access exist with data time series of fish abundance. There is no standardized protocol or specific design required for reporting at the international level. Routine scientific sampling of fish eggs and larvae (ichthyoplankton), juveniles, and adults has occurred since the start of commercial fisheries in support of their management. The abundance of many exploited stocks of fish as well as non-target species is routinely assessed by scientific sampling (e.g., trawl nets, hook and line, traps) and active acoustics  combined with trawling. Fish are also observed using mark-recapture and electronic tracking (biologging), which can provide finer scale data on distribution (geographic and depth), phenology, habitat selection, and ecological interactions. However, the methods of collection and analysis of data on fish can vary widely, and the spatio-temporal coverage is heterogeneous. Thus, while significant amounts of data exist, standardized data on the abundance and distribution of all types of fish, both fished and unfished, are needed. Many RFMOs have access to large amounts of data from scientific surveys, while global databases of fish abundance and their time series are still missing. Some programs aim to fill the gaps (e.g. Indicators of the Seas – IndiSeas), with an attempt to gather collections of fisheries independent data, and analyse them to evaluate the status of marine ecosystems.
                
                - 'Abondance et distribution de tortues, oiseaux et mammifères marins' : As wide-ranging, relatively long-lived and large-bodied animals, marine turtle, bird, and mammal species play a crucial role in maintaining the health of their ecosystems. These charismatic megafauna interact with and influence population dynamics and distribution of numerous prey species. To evaluate these interactions and their variability, an understanding of turtle, bird and mammal abundance and distribution is essential. Stock assessment analyses require accurate, up-to-date information on abundance and distribution in order to inform appropriate management and/or conservation measures. This EOV will facilitate evaluation of the potential impacts of several pressures on upper trophic levels of marine food webs (see the drivers and pressures in specification sheet below). Abundance refers to the number of individuals within a population while distribution refers to the geographic or spatial extent of habitats used by individuals from the population. The majority of species of marine turtles, birds and mammals are long-lived, K-selected organisms; as such they are particularly vulnerable to human impacts such as fisheries – both through reduction of their prey species and incidental capture in fishing gear, i.e., bycatch – and climate change (e.g. reduction of habitat for Arctic species) and provide longer term indicators of ecosystem health. Also, by virtue of their position high in the food web, they are susceptible to toxins and contaminants that bio-accumulate or accumulate up the food chain. As humans occupy a similar trophic position to these organisms, turtles, sea birds and particularly marine mammals can act as sentinels for human health risks. Finally, marine turtles, birds and mammals are often protected by national and international regulation, or recognized as needing such protection to prevent extinction (e.g., Red List of Threatened Species, CITES). As such, the high profile of these marine megafauna species can be used to engage and educate stakeholders, governments, and the public on ocean health and other issues.           
                
                - 'Composition et couverture des coraux durs' : Hard corals are the principal architects of coral reefs, supporting the high biodiversity and productivity of shallow, tropical coral reef systems. Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and highly valued ecosystems worldwide for their ecosystem goods and services. They are also one of the most threatened ecosystems of the world. Many people that depend on coral reefs live in low-income tropical countries. Healthy reefs are a foundation for their livelihood and food security; some products derived from coral reefs have global markets, including ornamental fish, cement, and tourism and recreation. Climate change, ocean acidification, fisheries, pollution, and coastal development are all significant threats to coral reefs. Hard corals are particularly vulnerable because they are slow-growing and susceptible to stress, particularly when there are synergies between natural and anthropogenic stresses. The health and areal extent of the hard coral community within a reef are direct indicators of the ability of a system to sustain the diversity of associated species, productivity, and valuable ecosystem services. Multiple measures give fundamental information on the health of a coral reef: live hard coral cover and the areal extent of a reef are the most important indicators of whether a reef is in a coral-dominated state or not; the composition and diversity of coral taxa is an important index of reef health; coral condition (e.g. bleaching, disease) gives fundamental information on the health of a reef; the size class structure (and recruitment) of hard corals gives fundamental information on the resilience, disturbance history and recovery potential of a reef. ‘Hard’ and ‘soft’ corals are key taxonomic groups dominating hard and some soft substractes in subtidal habitats from the shallows to the deep ocean, and from the equator to polar regions. This wide range of habitats can be grouped into three principal assemblages: tropical hard coral communities (coral reefs), soft coral-dominanted habitats, and deep- or cold-water coral communities. This specification sheet is focused on the former – tropical hard coral communities – to meet the immediate need there. Parallel specification sheets have been developed for other hard- and soft-coral dominated habitats.
                
                - 'Composition et couverture des herbiers marins' : Seagrasses are vascular plants that that can reproduce by flowering (sexually) and also spread asexually through rhizome extension. They can form dense, submerged meadows in coastal and estuarine waters. There are approximately 72 seagrass species that belong to four major groups. Seagrasses are often highly productive and provide essential habitat and nursery areas for many finfish, shellfish, charismatic megafauna, and species of concern, including sea turtles, dugongs and manatees. Seagrasses also help stabilize and protect coasts by binding underlying sediments. They contribute to good water quality by trapping sediment and absorbing nutrient runoff. Seagrasses are recognized as a “blue” carbon storage system, by fixing inorganic carbon via photosynthesis and storing and sequestering it in seagrass rhizomes and associated sediments. Although coastal vegetated habitats comprise only 0.2% of the world ocean they contribute >10% of all carbon buried annually in the sea. Vigorous photosynthesis by seagrasses can also reduce the acidity of surrounding water by removing dissolved carbon dioxide. Seagrasses are declining worldwide as a result of coastal development, nutrient loading that leads to poor light conditions on the sea floor, climate change, and cascading impacts of fishing. Loss of resources, including biological habitats such as seagrass meadows, is a major concern for governments worldwide and emerges as a major societal pressure motivating international conventions and bodies focused on ocean environment and resources. Regular monitoring of seagrass cover and ecosystem structure will be useful to modelling coastal and reef fishery production, the global carbon cycle, and tracking impacts of climate change and coastal eutrophication.
                
                - 'Composition et couverture de la canopée de macroalgues' : Macroalgal forests (dominated by kelp and fucoid brown algae) are iconic on rocky reefs around the world’s temperate coasts. These highly diverse ecosystems provide many important functions and services including high primary production, provision of nursery areas, human food resources, and protection from coastal erosion. Macroalgal forests are vulnerable to global threats such as ocean warming and to regional stressors resulting from intensifying human activities along the coast, including habitat degradation, pollution, eutrophication, and spread of invasive species. The compounded effects of global and regional stressors are eroding the resilience of these systems, making regime shifts and population collapses more likely. Regime shifts such as the replacement of macroalgal canopies by less productive, low-diversity assemblages of turf-forming algae and barren habitat are increasingly observed on many reefs around the world. Vulnerability begets sensitivity and macroalgal forests respond quickly to deteriorating environmental conditions, potentially allowing the early detection of impending regime shifts. Furthermore, their broad distribution from boreal to temperate regions allows for comparison of latitudinal trends and the tracking of geographic shifts in species ranges. Macroalgal forests provide a sensitive and well understood indicator of changing coastal marine environments, and are also models for understanding more complex interactions influencing marine communities, building on the detailed experimental knowledge and basic ecological understanding accumulated for these systems over decades. 
                
                - 'Mangrove cover and composition': Mangroves are intertidal, tree-dominated wetlands distributed along tropical and subtropical coastlines and estuaries around the world.  Under the influence of ocean tides, these forests are periodically inundated with waters ranging from slightly brackish to hypersaline.  Trees in this environment must survive in dynamically flooded, anoxic, and saline soils, and the adaptations that they employ to tolerate the physiological challenges provided by these conditions distinguish the evolutionarily diverse mangrove plant taxa (McKee 1996; Scholander et al. 1962).  Mangroves mediate key biogeochemical fluxes (Kristensen et al. 2008), are highly productive (Bouillon et al. 2008), and support rich biological communities (Nagelkerken et al. 2008).  The functions performed by these ecosystems often translate into valuable services for humans.  They protect coastal communities from erosion and damage from storm surges (Das and Vincent 2009), filter terrestrial run-off (Ewel et al. 1998), supply timber, and generate significant revenue through ecotourism and biodiversity conservation (Costanza et al. 1997).  Mangroves provide critical nursery habitat for marine species around the world (Hutchinson et al. 2015).  This nursery function adds considerable value to coastal fisheries, with each hectare of fringe mangrove in the Gulf of California, Mexico, estimated to provide $37,500 (U.S.) per year in fisheries production (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008).  Globally, mangroves sequester and store more carbon than almost any other type of ecosystem (Donato et al. 2011).  Estimates of the total amount of carbon stored by mangroves range from 3 Pg C (Hutchinson et al. 2014) to 20 Pg C (by Donato et al.’s (2011) estimate of 1,000 tons C/ha). Despite growing appreciation for the economic value of mangroves, these forests are severely threatened, with about 1% destroyed each year globally (Duarte et al. 2013).  Unsustainable coastal forestry, agriculture, aquaculture, and urbanization and infrastructure development, along with increasing sea level, have already resulted in the cumulative loss of more than 35% of global mangrove cover (Valiela et al. 2001).  In addition to these rapid anthropogenic declines, mangrove forests are naturally dynamic, made up of species adapted to aggressive colonization of open intertidal habitat and capable of shifting their distributions with changes in coastal geomorphology (Thom, 1967).  Taking into account their ecological and social value, dynamic distributions, and severe recent losses to human impacts, mangroves require urgent management, including restoration, and monitoring.  Several studies have estimated mangrove area (Giri et al. 2011, Hamilton & Casey 2015) and biomass (Hutchinson et al. 2014), but the dynamic distribution of this biome requires a globally integrated and consistent approach based on high temporal and spatial resolution data.  Global mangrove area was estimated in the year 2000 to cover 137,760 km2 in 118 countries, with more than 50% of this area in six countries (Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, and Malaysia) (data from the year 2000; Giri et al. 2011). In a more recent analysis, global forest area was recently estimated in the year 2012 as 81,684 km2 in areas delineated as mangrove forest and 167,387 km2 within wider mangrove biome with only 20 countries containing greater than 80% of the global mangrove holdings.  (Hamilton & Casey 2016). While researchers in the countries with large areas of mangroves are contributing valuable information, the value of this information could be extended with support from international initiatives.

                - 'Couleur des océans' : The term ‘ocean colour’ broadly refers to the spectral radiance emanating from the sun that is backscattered off the upper part of the oceanic water column, and which contains information on the properties of the water and its constituents. The phenomenon of colour is the result of absorption and scattering, as light interacts with the water and materials suspended or dissolved within it (i.e., the optically active ‘constituents’). Ocean colour encompasses a multitude of biological, biogeochemical, and ecological properties of the ocean, and is an EOV because changes in the colour of the ocean can be related to changes in the presence and magnitude of living and non-living particles and of dissolved materials in the water. The measurement of ocean colour enables differentiation and classification of different water bodies because the colour of any particular ocean region depends on the proportion, type, and vertical distribution of different dissolved or particulate materials and the depth of the water. Ocean colour is useful for evaluating the health of an ecosystem and to inform resource management, such as fisheries and recreation, in the coastal and open ocean but also in lakes and other inland water bodies. It is also useful to estimate water quality and the amount of heat that accumulates as the ocean absorbs sunlight. In order to fully use the ocean’s optical properties to conduct broad ocean science and applications, it is critical for users to understand what type of waters are being observed, and also understand the limitations and possible errors in what are called ‘ocean colour products’. These products include the Ocean Colour sub-variables and derived products shown in Table 1. Measurements of ocean colour (Table 1) include the intensity and spectral variability of light backscattered from below the ocean surface, vertical profiles of the colour of water, and measures of inherent optical properties like the absorption or scattering coefficient. Current methods to observe the ocean’s optical properties include underwater optical sensors as well as airborne and satellite observations. These sensors passively measure sunlight backscattered from the upper layers of the ocean. Active sensors equipped with various light sources, including lasers of different colours and filters, are also used to probe the vertical distribution and composition of dissolved and particulate matter and the depth of coastal waters. Ocean Colour Remote Sensing (OCRS) encompasses radiometric techniques that are continuously evolving. Radiometers measure the solar energy backscattered by the ocean looking at the sea surface from a variety of platforms (satellites, suborbital manned aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The water-leaving radiances at different wavelengths contain information on the ocean albedo and the in-water constituents. Water leaving radiances by remote sensing from satellites or high-altitude aircraft are derived from the top-of atmosphere (TOA) radiances after accounting for the atmospheric contribution to the remotely-sensed ocean colour signal, a process referred to as ‘atmospheric correction’. Products derived from OCRS include phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, biogeochemical and ecological indices including water quality measures, metrics to gauge phytoplankton physiology, and indicators of ecosystem status and health. Environmental variables such as bathymetry, dissolved organic carbon, and suspended sediment concentration can be derived from OCRS. Additional products useful to model light propagation through the water are derived and used to estimate surface ocean primary productivity, and to model the heating of the surface ocean. While the link between ocean colour and biogeochemistry is most often statistical, it is grounded in mechanistic understanding of the underlying phytoplankton physiology, biogeochemistry, ecology, and optics of the ocean. The derivation of OCRS products from aircraft and satellites involves complex modelling of required ancillary measurements including solar illumination, atmospheric conditions to estimate radiance reflected and

                - 'Paysage acoustique des océans' : Sound propagates so well in the ocean that it is the most effective way to probe the marine environment and communicate over long distances. Sound is critical for marine life and for seagoing humans. Most fish and invertebrates sense sound-induced particle movement; some fish and all mammals detect changes in sound pressure. Many marine animals produce sound, from the long-range, low-frequency calls of baleen whales and spawning fish to the intense high-frequency impulses of snapping shrimp and echolocation clicks of toothed whales. Acoustic cues are essential for larvae to settle in appropriate environments, for the mating systems of many fish and mammals, for predator-prey relationships, and for social species to maintain cohesion. Humans have also learned how to benefit from the physical properties of sound in the ocean. Sonar is used to detect objects such as fish schools, mines, and submarines, to map the seafloor, and to measure sea ice thickness. Acoustic monitoring of the sounds produced by marine life is being developed as an efficient and low-cost alternative to sightings data for assessing the status of populations, habitats and ecosystems. Acoustic technologies are continuously developing as a way to measure physical properties of the entire water column and distribution of marine life over distances from a few centimeters to thousands of kilometers. Active sound sources are used to detect targets and enable underwater geo-positioning systems for floats or autonomous underwater vehicles. Sound pulses from air guns are used in seismic surveys to detect geological strata and hydrocarbons thousands of meters below the seafloor. Ocean sound is also used to monitor and locate earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions. Ambient sound is used to image the structure of the upper few hundreds of kilometers of the earth’s crust and mantle. Over the past century, humans have altered the sound field of the oceans. Marine activities such as motorized shipping have elevated ambient sound levels throughout much of the ocean at some frequencies. Recent research has begun to uncover ways in which anthropogenic noise affects marine life. These results trigger regulatory requirements in the Exclusive Economic Zones of many nations to reduce or manage the impacts of noise, which in turn drives research on effects. This acoustic EOV will forge major advances in our understanding of ocean sound, how different sources of anthropogenic sound affect ocean ambient, the effects sound has on marine life, and how acoustic monitoring can be used to assess biodiversity and ecosystem health. We know that anthropogenic noise can harm marine life in the short term, but more extended observations are required to define long-term effects on populations and ecosystems. Understanding the effects of ocean noise as a stressor requires estimating how ocean sound has changed historically, requires mapping sound throughout the oceans on a global scale over decades, and requires predicting sound fields that result from changes in the use of the oceans. The largest anthropogenic changes in the acoustic environment of the ocean are associated with industrialized coastal regions and major shipping lanes. Furthermore, the characteristics of the acoustic environment will evolve with transformations of the physical environment due to climate change. More extreme weather events will affect sound generated by wind and waves in the oceans. Reduced sea ice will affect the propagation of sound and change the sound generating mechanisms in the polar regions. Increased calving from ice shelves will increase the sound levels in the adjacent seas and fjords. Changes in physical and biogeochemical ocean parameters will influence the ecosystems and migration patterns of fish and marine mammals. These climate-related changes can be observed by passive acoustic monitoring. The amount of sound energy absorbed by the oceans is affected by pH, and the degree to which ocean acidification will reduce absorption and increase ambient noise is under investigation. Sound propagates faster in warmer oceans, and this property can be exploited to make unique observations of climate change over large ocean volumes, including the ice-covered regions in the Arctic.
